# l3io-wordpress-config — local developer entry points.
#
# CI is replayed locally with nektos/act, configured by .actrc plus
# .act.{vars,env,secrets}. The same workflow files run here and on GitHub.
#
# First-time setup:
#   make act-init   copies .act.{vars,env,secrets}.example -> .act.{vars,env,secrets}
#
# `make ci` runs act under `infisical run`, as ADR-0013 specifies and as the
# sibling repositories do. ci.yml itself uses no secrets; the environment is
# needed because ~/.actrc declares them (see ACT_RUNNER below).
#
# Useful targets:
#   make lint         ruff check + format --check
#   make types        mypy --strict
#   make test         pytest
#   make contracts    the architecture gates (AD-27, AD-1, AD-2)
#   make check        lint + types + contracts + test, the whole local gate
#   make ci           replay the whole CI pipeline locally via act
#   make ci-job JOB=  replay one job, e.g. make ci-job JOB=contracts
#   make ci-dryrun    parse and plan the workflow without running it
#   make build        uv build --no-sources

ACT_FILES := .act.vars .act.env .act.secrets
UV := uv

# ~/.actrc declares secrets as bare `-s NAME`, which act resolves from the
# environment; `infisical run` is what puts them there. act prompts for any
# that are unset OR empty and then fails on a non-interactive terminal, so the
# secrets have to be present even though ci.yml uses none of them. That includes
# GITHUB_TOKEN: an earlier version of this file left it unset on the claim that
# act does not prompt for it, and on 2026-10-12 act 0.2.89 did, failing every
# `make ci-job` outside a TTY.
#
# Do NOT substitute placeholder values. A bogus GITHUB_TOKEN is worse than an
# absent one: act passes it to git as a credential when fetching actions, and
# the fetch fails with "authentication required" instead of proceeding
# anonymously.
#
# Kept identical to l3io-wordpress-database's Makefile. INFISICAL_ENV must be
# prod: `infisical secrets` returns an empty string, exit 0, for any other.

# `make ci` runs ci.yml for real. publish.yml and release.yml are deliberately
# outside it -- act has no OIDC and ignores job.permissions, so running them
# locally would be misleading at best, and release.yml CREATES TAGS and dispatches
# publishes, which must never happen from a laptop.
#
# A dry run is the middle ground and it is worth more than it looks. act resolves
# every `uses:` ref against the remote before deciding to skip the step, so a
# dryrun fails on an action version that does not exist -- it is what catches
# `changelog-parser@v3.0.14`, a real version of a DIFFERENT action, which no
# amount of YAML validation would have found. It also catches expression syntax
# errors, unknown contexts and missing `needs`.
#
# --dryrun IS LOAD-BEARING, not a nicety. Without it this target cuts real tags
# and fires real publishes. A contract test asserts every workflow named here is
# run with it, so removing it fails `make check` rather than surprising someone.

#
# ci.yml is NOT dry-run: `make ci` runs it for real, and act SEGFAULTS dry-running
